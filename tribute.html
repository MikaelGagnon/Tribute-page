                        <p>Lewis struggled at school as a young boy.</p>
                        <p>His father, Anthony Hamilton, noticed his natural tallent for racing remote-controlled cars.</p>

                        <p>Despite his meager wealth, Lewis' father bought him a go kart at the age of 8.</p>
                        <p>Lewis learned his race-craft in his old, underperforming go kart.</p>
                        <p>His slow kart meant he could only qualify at the back of the grid and that he would need to overtake the entire field to secure wins.</p>
                        <p>One of Lewis's karting rivals and friend was Nico Rosberg, who would ultimately race alongside Lewis in Formula 1.</p>
